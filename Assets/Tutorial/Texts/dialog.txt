Hello!
Just by looking at you, I can tell you're new aren't you?
Don't worry, I'll guide you through the what's and how's of this place.
The point of the game is to survive the incoming waves of enemies.
You can do this by building towers on empty building slots.
_tower_Try it now!
_gold_Good! As you can see, this took a chunk off your gold.
_gold_Building defense towers consumes your gold. But don't worry, killing enemies will get you some back.
_wave_Enemies come in waves. You can check the current wave number there in the arrow.
_health_Every time an enemy reaches your tower, you lose health.
_health_If it reaches zero, you lose!
I'll have some of our man run a practise round for you. Let's see how you do.
Set up your defenses in the way you like best.
_nextwave_When you're ready, click this button to call the next wave.
Good luck!
